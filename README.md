# 🤖 Doc-Sentinel AI: Agentic Documentation Governance

**Doc-Sentinel AI** is a CI/CD-integrated solution designed to eliminate **Documentation Debt**—the widening gap between rapid code deployment and accurate technical content. By leveraging **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** and **GitHub Actions**, it provides a scalable "safety net" for technical accuracy in high-velocity development environments.



---

## 🎯 The Product Vision
In complex cloud ecosystems (like AWS Greengrass), a single casing error in a parameter (e.g., `DeviceID` vs `deviceid`) can break a customer's production environment. **Doc-Sentinel** acts as a "First Responder" for technical truth, ensuring that every code push is automatically reconciled with its documentation to reduce support overhead and improve **Developer Experience (DX)**.

## 🚀 Strategic Features
* **Semantic Integrity Audits:** Uses LLM orchestration to understand the *intent* of code changes, identifying logic shifts that traditional regex-based linters miss.
* **Zero-Friction CI/CD:** Operates natively within the **SDLC** via GitHub Actions, ensuring governance doesn't slow down the release cycle.
* **Risk-Based Reporting:** Flags "Critical" discrepancies in parameters and function signatures, prioritizing documentation that impacts system stability.
* **Agentic Perception:** Autonomously observes code diffs, reasons through technical impact, and generates precise remediation steps without human prompting.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **LLM Orchestration:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Optimized for 1M+ token context windows)
* **System Logic:** Python 3.10 & PyGithub
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
* **Governance:** Secure environment secret management for API authentication

## 🧪 The Governance Workflow
1.  **Event Trigger:** A developer pushes a code change (e.g., updating a function signature or parameter casing).
2.  **State Capture:** The agent fetches the latest `git diff` and corresponding documentation via the GitHub API.
3.  **Cross-Functional Analysis:** Gemini 2.0 evaluates the code change against the Markdown to detect "Technical Drift." 
4.  **Strategic Remediation:** If a mismatch is found, the agent logs a ready-to-use update, reducing the time-to-fix from hours to seconds.

## 🗺️ Roadmap: Scaling the Impact
* [x] **Phase 1: Automated Detection & Reporting** (Current MVP)
* [ ] **Phase 2: Global Repository Health** (Support for multi-file audits and recursive scanning)
* [ ] **Phase 3: Autonomous Remediation** (Agent opens a PR with corrected documentation for human review)
* [ ] **Phase 4: Stakeholder Dashboard** (Strategic oversight for Product Managers and Documentation Leads)
